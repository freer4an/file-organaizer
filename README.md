# Simple file organaizer with Qt
This is my first ever project I have created by myself as a student so do not judge strictly :)
## Deserves attention
If you have not worked with Qt
There is a part of code like 
```python
 def getSettingValuesMain(self):
        self.setting_variables = QtCore.QSettings("app_name", "Main Window Variables")
```
QSettings helps to save settings of your application to system regisrty(on Windows). 
In this project QSettings used to save folder name if you want to come up with your own variations.
It's not working good actually because I used it wrong. But whatever. This is how I end my first readme file :D
